This directory contains notes on some experiments with the use of automation in Isabelle, and its Sledgehammer tool in particular. My hope is that the data will provide insight as to what automation can and cannot do in the context of interactive theorem proving.

The first experiment involves a proof of the mutilated chessboard theorem:

The second experiment involves a proof that there are infinitely many primes congruent to three modulo four. The notes are shorter and the conclusion is more optimistic.
