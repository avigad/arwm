# Automated Reasoning for the Working Mathematician

I have set up this repository to help me prepare a talk for [FroCoS / Tableau](https://frocos2019.org/) in September 2019. The audience will include developers of automated reasoning tools, and I would like to say something about the sorts of tools that are useful to those of us interested in formalizing mathematics. I have prepared some preliminary notes here:

If you have done any substantial formalization of mathematics, I would like to know:

- What kinds of automation have you found helpful?
- What kinds of automation do you think would be helpful?

Even a quick, short response will be appreciated, and if you don't think automation is useful or necessary, you can say so. If you can point to particular examples where automated tools proved useful, or particular examples of inferences that were painful to justify by hand, that would be especially helpful.

You can post an answer as a comment to Issue #1 in this repository. (The public meant to encourage discussion, so that is welcome, too.) You can also write me privately at <avigad@cmu.edu>.

Feel free to share this request with anyone who may be interested.
